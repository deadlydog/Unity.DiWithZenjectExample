# Dependency Injection with Zenject Example

This project was created while following Andrew Kuipers' guide at https://deimors.github.io/UnityDependencyInjection/

It is just a simple small Unity project that shows how to do dependency injection in Unity using Zenject, as well as how to organize your code into Assembly Definitions and use a Domain Driven Design (DDD) approach.
